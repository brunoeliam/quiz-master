    <string name="Reglas">Quiz Game consists of a question and answer game in which the user must first select a category, and then answer five questions related to the chosen topic. For each question, four different options are available, and the player must select the one they consider correct. Additionally, there is a \'lifeline\' or \'wild card\' to skip the current question, which can be used once per round. At the end of each round, the score will be displayed on the screen.</string>
